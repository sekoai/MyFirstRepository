                        <h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>
                        <p>At just 15 years old, Thabo started working at the only village shop in Serutle. With no cash payment available, his annual contract was for 9 goats - paid at the end of each year.</p>
                        <p>"I would wake up at 4am to clean the shop before it opened at 6am," Thabo recalls. "My duties included stocking shelves, serving customers, and keeping accounts in a handwritten book."</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
                            <p>Those early years taught me the value of hard work and customer service. Even when paid in goats, I knew I was building something valuable.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>The Turning Point</h2>
                        <p>After 5 years of working for goats, Thabo had accumulated a small herd. He made his first business move by selling some goats to buy basic goods which he resold from his family's home.</p>
                        <p>"I started with just soap, matches, and paraffin - items people needed daily. My mother allowed me to use one room in our house as a tiny shop."</p>
                        
                        <h2>Growth and Expansion</h2>
                        <p>Within two years, Thabo's home shop was making more profit than the village shop where he worked. He made the bold decision to focus on his own business full-time.</p>
                        <p>Key milestones in Thabo's journey:</p>
                        <ul class="timeline">
                            <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Home shop with basic goods</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Rented a small shop space in the village</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> Opened second location in neighboring village</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 8:</strong> First shop in Maseru with cash registers</li>
                            <li><strong>Present:</strong> 5 shops across Maseru with 15 employees</li>
                        </ul>
