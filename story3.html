                        <h2>A Boy's Contract: 2 Cows Per Year</h2>
                        <p>At age 12, Thabiso started working as a cattle herder for a wealthy farmer in Serutle village. Like most boys in rural Lesotho, his annual payment came not in cash but in livestock - two healthy cows per year of service [citation:3][citation:10].</p>
                        <p>"I remember my father saying this was the way boys become men - through caring for cattle," Thabiso recalls. "For three years, I woke before sunrise to tend the herd, slept in the fields during rainy seasons, and learned every inch of grazing land."</p>
                        
                        <div class="highlight-box">
                            <i class="fas fa-quote-left"></i>
                            <p>Those six cows I earned became my university. While other boys spent their payments on weddings or sold them for quick cash, I saw each animal as a business partner that could multiply.</p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <h2>The Strategic Herd Growth</h2>
                        <p>By age 15, Thabiso had accumulated six cows through his labor contracts. While this was already substantial wealth in village terms, he implemented a strategic breeding program:</p>
                        <ul class="timeline">
                            <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> Kept all female calves, traded males for veterinary medicines</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 3:</strong> Had 14 cattle - used 4 to pay for butchery training in Maseru</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 5:</strong> Herd of 32 cattle - sold 10 to buy a refrigerated truck</li>
                            <li><strong>Year 7:</strong> 50 cattle plus contracts with 3 village shops for meat supply</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>This careful growth mirrored traditional Basotho cattle culture while incorporating modern business principles [citation:10].</p>
                        
                        <h2>Breaking Tradition: From Herder to Entrepreneur</h2>
                        <p>At 22, Thabiso made two controversial decisions that changed his trajectory:</p>
                        
                        <div class="comparison">
                            <div class="traditional">
                                <h3><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i> Traditional Path</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keep growing herd indefinitely</li>
                                    <li>Use cattle only for lobola (bride price) and status</li>
                                    <li>Never slaughter breeding stock</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div class="modern">
                                <h3><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i> Thabiso's Choice</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sold prized bull to fund butcher shop</li>
                                    <li>Focused on meat quality over herd size</li>
                                    <li>Invested in cold chain infrastructure</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>This shift from viewing cattle as status symbols to seeing them as business assets caused tension with his family but proved financially successful [citation:3][citation:7].</p>
                        
                        <h2>The Meat Processing Breakthrough</h2>
                        <p>Thabiso's big opportunity came when he secured a contract to supply schools under a government feeding program. This required:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Meeting food safety standards (built hygienic slaughter facility)</li>
                            <li>Consistent supply (partnered with 15 small cattle farmers)</li>
                            <li>Reliable delivery (purchased two more refrigerated trucks)</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p>The government contract became the foundation for his current operation - Thabiso Meat Packers - which now supplies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>23 schools in Maseru district</li>
                            <li>4 supermarket chains</li>
                            <li>Export contracts to South Africa</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <h2>Modernizing While Honoring Tradition</h2>
                        <p>Today, Thabiso blends modern meat processing with cultural values:</p>
