  <h2><i class="fas fa-tractor"></i> Tumelo’s Journey: From Contract Laborer to Rich Taxi Owner</h2>
  <article class="story-content">
    <p>
      At the age of <strong>20</strong>, Tumelo from <strong>Serutle</strong> made a bold move toward financial independence. 
      After working a tough <strong>one-year contract job in Sekubu</strong>, he was paid with a cow. 
      Tumelo sold the cow for <strong>M8,000</strong> and used the money to pursue his dream of farming.
    </p>
    <p>
      He invested in <strong>potato seeds</strong> and rented land in <strong>Manamela</strong>. 
      To enrich his soil, he used manure from his father’s animals. His first harvest was a success, 
      and he quickly became a recognized young farmer supplying local markets with quality produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tumelo didn’t stop there. With savings from farming, he bought his first taxi and began 
      working routes between villages and towns. His reliability and business sense allowed him 
      to grow quickly in the transport industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Tumelo is a proud <strong>taxi fleet owner in Leribe</strong>, with several taxis operating 
      under his name. His income has grown significantly, and he is known as a 
      <i class="fas fa-coins"></i> <strong>successful and wealthy businessman</strong> in the region.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a cow earned through hard work to a taxi empire—Tumelo's story teaches us that 
      vision, sacrifice, and determination can change a person’s destiny.
